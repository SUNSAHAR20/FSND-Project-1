This Website is to be able to have a collection of movies which are stored in an array
and then each movie object is sent to a seperate file whre it is converted into its corresponding
movie poster image,name and on clicking it the movie website will automatically appear.

This website includes three python files
1.media.py
2.entertainment.py
3.fresh_tomatoes.py

NOTE : it is prefferable to use Python 2.7 as it is not back compatible(Python)

Pls check if all the files are saved and then run only the *entertainment.py*file 

The required website will be created.
